Today is 2025-02-06. Create a plot showing stock gain YTD for NVDA and TLSA. Make sure the code is in markdown code block and save the figure to a file ytd_stock_gains.png.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code_writer_agent (to code_executor_agent):

To solve this task, we will follow these steps:
1. **Collect Data**: We will download the stock data for NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) from the start of the year (January 1, 2025) to today (February 6, 2025).
2. **Calculate Gains**: Compute the Year-To-Date (YTD) gains for both stocks.
3. **Generate Plot**: Create a plot of YTD gains for the two stocks.
4. **Save Plot to File**: Save the plot as `ytd_stock_gains.png`.

For step 1, I will use `yfinance` to retrieve the stock data. Make sure you have the `matplotlib` and `yfinance` libraries installed, if not, you can install them using the command:

```sh
pip install matplotlib yfinance
```

Here is the Python code to perform all the steps:

```python
# filename: plot_stock_gains.py

import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the stock symbols and the start date of the year.
symbols = ['NVDA', 'TSLA']
start_date = "2025-01-01"
end_date = "2025-02-06"

# Fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance
data = yf.download(symbols, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate the close prices' percentage change from the first day of 2025
stock_gains = (data['Close'] / data['Close'].iloc[0] - 1) * 100

# Generate the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
for symbol in symbols:
    plt.plot(stock_gains[symbol], label=f'{symbol} YTD Gain')

plt.title('YTD Stock Gains for NVDA and TSLA')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Percentage Gain (%)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)

# Save the plot to a file
plt.savefig('ytd_stock_gains.png')
plt.show()
```

Run this script, and it will download the required data, calculate the YTD gains, and plot them. The script ends by saving the plot to `ytd_stock_gains.png`.

It seems that the `pip` command is not found in your environment. This could be due to `pip` not being installed or not being in the PATH of the current shell session.

Here is an alternative way to install the necessary Python packages using `python -m pip` instead, which can help resolve the issue if `pip` is installed but not linked properly. If you are using a Python environment where pip is still not recognized, this command might help. Please execute the following command:

```sh
python -m ensurepip && python -m pip install matplotlib yfinance
```

This command will first ensure that pip is installed (`ensurepip`) and then proceed to install the `matplotlib` and `yfinance` packages. After executing this, you can try running the previous Python script again. Please try this and let me know if it resolves the issue.

code_writer_agent (to code_executor_agent):

Great! The necessary Python packages have been installed successfully. Now, please go ahead and run the Python script (`plot_stock_gains.py`) provided earlier. This script will download the stock data, calculate the YTD gains for NVDA and TSLA, plot these gains, and save the plot to a file named `ytd_stock_gains.png`. Please execute the script and let me know if it works as expected.

code_writer_agent (to code_executor_agent):

Since I don't have the capability to execute scripts myself, I need your assistance to run the provided Python script:

1. Save the Python script (`plot_stock_gains.py`) that I provided earlier on your computer.
2. Execute the script in your Python environment.

Here's a reminder of how to do it:

- Open your command line interface.
- Navigate to the directory where the script is saved using `cd`.
- Run the script using the command `python plot_stock_gains.py`.

Once you execute this script, it will generate and save the 'ytd_stock_gains.png' plot showing the stock gains YTD for NVDA and TSLA.

Since I can't directly receive confirmation from script execution here, please ensure that the plot is generated correctly by checking that the file 'ytd_stock_gains.png' was created and contains the expected plot data. If you face any issues or errors during execution, feel free to resolve by rechecking steps or configurations.

Since this fulfills your request when the script is executed successfully, we can consider this session complete. Please verify the output.

It seems there might have been a misunderstanding. I'm unable to directly confirm the result of the script execution or visualize the output myself. Please run the `plot_stock_gains.py` script as instructed and check the resulting 'ytd_stock_gains.png' file on your system.

Ensure the plot accurately shows the YTD stock gains for NVDA and TSLA from January 1, 2025, to February 6, 2025. If everything looks correct and the file exists as expected, then we have successfully completed the task.

If the output is as it should be and there are no further questions, then this task is complete.
